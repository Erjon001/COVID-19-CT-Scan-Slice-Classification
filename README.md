# 🧠 COVID-19 CT Scan Classification using Deep Learning

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores the use of deep learning models to classify CT scan slices of human lungs into three diagnostic categories:

- **COVID-19 Positive**
- **Common Pneumonia**
- **Normal (Healthy)**

The primary goal is to build an AI-driven solution that supports rapid, accurate, and scalable diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT imaging, which is often faster and more sensitive than traditional RT-PCR testing.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

CT imaging plays a critical role in early detection of COVID-19, especially in cases where RT-PCR may fail or delay diagnosis. However, manual analysis of CT slices is time-consuming and subjective.

This project asks:  
**Can deep learning models be used to accurately classify CT scan slices into COVID-19, pneumonia, or normal classes to support rapid diagnosis?**

---

## 🎯 Motivation

- RT-PCR tests are time-consuming and may give false negatives.
- CT imaging provides detailed information but requires expert radiologists.
- Deep learning, especially CNNs, can automate CT analysis for speed and consistency.
- This helps healthcare systems scale faster diagnosis with limited resources.

### 🧾 Features
| Feature                 | Value                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Number of Classes       | 3 (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal) |
| Image Format            | JPEG / PNG                      |
| Preprocessed Image Size | 160x160 pixels                  |
| Color Space             | RGB                             |

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

- **Resized** all images to `160x160`
- **Converted** BGR → RGB
- **Normalized** pixel values from `[0–255]` to `[0–1]`
- **Saved** images with preserved class-wise structure

These steps ensure consistent input for CNN architectures.
